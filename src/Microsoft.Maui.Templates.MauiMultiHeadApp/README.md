# .NET MAUI Multi-Project App Templates

A set of project and solution templates to get started using .NET MAUI with a multi-project app.

Instead of a single project, there is a separate project for each platform as well as a project
for the main shared code. This is very similar to Xamarin.Forms default project templates.
