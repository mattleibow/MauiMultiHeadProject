# .NET MAUI Multi-Project App

This is a sample and template to help people during the
migration - or if they still want to keep the multiple projects.
One reason to have multiple projects is if you need to have very
different versions of an app for a single platform.

To test the template, you can install it:

```
dotnet new install src\Microsoft.Maui.Templates.MauiMultiHeadApp\content --force
```

> If you want to uninstall, you can also use the path:
> 
> ```
> dotnet new uninstall src\Microsoft.Maui.Templates.MauiMultiHeadApp\content
> ```

The template should appear in your IDE:

Creating the project is as usual:

The next page will have check boxes for you to select platforms:
